# Profile

I’m Tony Ko — a Senior Software Engineer and UI Designer with 9+ years of experience crafting high-performance, secure, and accessible software across web, mobile, browser extensions, and embedded systems. I’ve delivered impactful solutions for top brands like Aeroplan, Air Miles, and Toyota, blending deep technical knowledge with a strong sense of design and usability.

Beyond code, I’m passionate about mentorship, team growth, and creating scalable systems that align with business goals. I lead with curiosity, ship with intention, and always aim to make things a little more beautiful, a little more performant, and a lot more human.
